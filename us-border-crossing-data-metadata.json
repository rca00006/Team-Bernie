This dataset tells about the incoming counts into the US. \n\nThis can prove to be a vital dataset to predict the average incoming counts into the future seeing the current trend. A primary look tells us that 77% of the incidents marked in the dataset consisted of US-Canada border meaning Canadians have tended to come in more frequently into the US as compared to the Mexicans. \n\nThis data can also prove to useful to predict the daily or weekly or monthly or annual traffic that\u0027s going to accumulate on the borders so that the authorities can be aware of the number beforehand."}
