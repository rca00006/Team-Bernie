# Supply Chain Technology Final Project – Team Bernie
## Project Overview
Which transport modes are most vulnerable to seasonal shocks? The goal of this project is to use Prophet, a prediction model to understand this data. Prophet will work well for this data because incorporates seasonal effects, missing data, and trend shift. The supporting source we are using for this is "Hyndman, R. J., & Athanasopoulos, G. (2021). Forecasting: Principles and Practice (3rd ed.). OTexts.https://otexts.com/fpp3/"
